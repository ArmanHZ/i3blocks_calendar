A GUI pop-up calendar for i3blocks written in Python.

# Requirements
* You need i3blocks. For Arch Linux use **sudo pacman -S i3blocks**
* You also need Python3. For Arch Linux use **sudo pacman -S python**

# Sample i3blocks code
Here the **[time]** block is just something I use, it is not necessary for the script.
<pre>
[calendar]
full_text=üìÜ
command=python3 $HOME/<b>path_to_the_script</b>/calendar_gui.py

[time]
label=‚è≥ 
command=date +"%a %d/%m/%y %T"
interval=1
</pre>

# How it looks
Click the Calendar emoji for the script to work. If emojis are not installed, you can change it to text. It should still work.
